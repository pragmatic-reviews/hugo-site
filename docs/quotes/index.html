 The computing scientist’s main challenge is not to get confused by the complexities of his own making.

   If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.

  <p>There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.</p>

  <p>How do we convince people that in programming simplicity and clarity — in short: what mathematicians call &#34;elegance&#34; — are not a dispensable luxury, but a crucial matter that decides between success and failure?</p>
